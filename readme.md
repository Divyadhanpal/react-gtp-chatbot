Run this project using "npm install" and "npm run dev"(as we are using vite package manager)

we are using chatgtp api in this project so need to update api token in config.js if we want this to work 

NOTE:Please create config.js file and add API_KEY in that as this is not supposed to be exposed iam hiding this in config.js file
